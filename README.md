This scripts make it possible to create a JSON from 3D model in revit using [PyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit). The JSON should
contain infos about the wall, roof and floor and also their thickness.
To add this plugin to revit, you need to copy the content of [JSON.pushbutton](JSON.pushbutton)
to this path:


**Users\User\AppData\Roaming\pyRevit-Master\extensions\pyRevitJSON.extension\JSON.pushbutton\ModelToJSON.tab\Convertor.panel\JSON.pushbutton**


<br />
Then it is necessary to reload the PyRevit in Revit. After adding the plugin to Revit it can be open by clicking on the icon while pressing Ctrl + Shift.

The Icon is taken from [ichon8](https://icons8.com/).
