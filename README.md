This scripts make it possible to create a JSON from 3D model in revit. The JSON should
contain infos about the wall, roof and floor and also their thickness.
To add this plugin to revit, you need to copy the content of [JSON.pushbutton](JSON.pushbutton)
to this path:


**Users\User\AppData\Roaming\pyRevit-Master\extensions\pyRevitJSON.extension\JSON.pushbutton\ModelToJSON.tab\Convertor.panel\JSON.pushbutton**


<br />
Then it is necessary to reload the PyRevit in Revit.
